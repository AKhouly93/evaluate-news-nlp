## Description
(Natural Language Processing) NLPs leverage machine learning and deep learning create a program that can interpret natural human speech. Systems like Alexa, Google Assistant, and many voice interaction programs are well known to us, but understanding human speech is an incredibly difficult task and requires a lot of resources to achieve.
In this app we use a sentiment analysis API from meaningcloud.com that helps us run NLP on articles or news and give us some analysis about its content.

This project is a practical application of using webpack build tool to build a final optimised version of a web app.
## Prerequisites
* Webserver - Node.js
* Web application framework for routing - Express
* Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and prod    environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
* External script - Service Worker
* External API - MeaningCloud


## Installation
1. In order to install the dependencies, make sure you're in the project directory then run the command `npm install` on the terminal
2. Run the following commands on the terminal
* `npm start` to start the backend server.
* `npm test` to test the javaScript code.
* `npm run build-dev` to run the app in development enivronment.
* `npm run build-prod` to run the app in production enivronment .The built version of the app is found inside the dist folder in the project root.
